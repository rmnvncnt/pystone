# pystone

A simple spider to download [Hearthstone](http://blizzard.com) decks from [Hearthpwn](http://www.hearthpwn.com)

To run this spider, execute `scrapy crawl hpspider -o output_file.json` from within the project directory (containing `spiders.py`).

Remember to mine respectfully and to go easy on the server!
